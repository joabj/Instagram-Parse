# Instagram-Parse
This script will (eventually) scrape photos/data from Instagram, creating a web page for each photo.

It relies on Instagram-Scraper (https://github.com/rarcega/instagram-scraper) to download a JSON blob of photo locations, comments, and metadata. 

I got it to work on my account, so, technically I got what I needed. One day, when I learn how to properly print nested Python lists/dictionaries, I can get it to work properly. This first iteration got me to the minimum data I need, which I'll parse further with regex.
